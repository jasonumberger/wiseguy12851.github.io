    Gulpfile:
    ===================
    Gulpfile has drastically changed once again, its been very long needing a
    rewrite. The old gulpfile mapped source folders to destination folders
    and did a complete build and re-copy from scratch everytime. While this
    worked great it also meant any little change would require a 5-10 minute
    re-build and made gulp.watch useless

     The new gulpfile takes a very different and largely more simplistic
     approach. Rather than take node/bower libraries and app source code and
     map it to different folders and such (Quite a complicated build process)
     It instead simply converts typescript and stylus to css in a generated
     folder and copies some fonts over. Then builds and minifies.

     Essentially there is no mapping of folders, the client folder is served
     as-is, exactly how you see it. Anything generated will be in the
     generated folder so it can safely be deleted. Some files are generated
     at the client root but gulp knows how to clean them up with the commands.

     This also allows bypassing the concatenated and/or minified files and
     just using the individual files where desired. It also allows viewing or
     downloading the raw typescript or stylus files and presents many future
     oppurtunities like serving up typescript files and converting them
     on-the-fly with middleware

     Gulp also now precompiles the libraries over, this is important as you
     wont get any of the libraries unless you run the "Precompile" task first
